# Social-Distancing-and-Alarming-System
Developed a real-time social distancing system using Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and LM35 temperature sensor to monitor proximity and ensure safety in public spaces.
By combining Moving Average and Kalman filters, noise was minimized, and detection accuracy was significantly improved.
The system was optimized with an interrupt-driven approach, reducing power consumption and false alerts.
LED indicators and alarms were integrated for quick, reliable notifications, showcasing how simple hardware and intelligent design can provide an affordable solution to safety challenges in environments like offices and schools.
