# Social-Distancing-and-Alarming-System
This project is aimed at creating a distance monitoring system using Arduino. It incorporates an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances from objects in real-time. The system uses NeoPixel LEDs to display different colors based on the measured distance, indicating proximity levels, and a buzzer for audible alerts.
