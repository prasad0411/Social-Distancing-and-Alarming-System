# Social-Distancing-and-Alarming-System
This project is aimed at creating a distance monitoring system using Arduino. It incorporates an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances from objects in real time. It also utilizes temperature sensors to gather temperature data to detect social distancing breaches. The system uses NeoPixel LEDs to display different colors based on the measured distance, indicating proximity levels, and a buzzer for audible alerts.
