# Social-Distancing-and-Alarming-System
The Social Distancing and Alarming System employs an Arduino-based distance monitoring setup. It incorporates an ultrasonic sensor to measure real-time object distances and temperature sensors for detecting social distancing breaches. NeoPixel LEDs indicate proximity levels through color changes, while a buzzer offers audible alerts. The code integrates the "Adafruit_NeoPixel.h" library and assigns pins for various components. It establishes distance thresholds, initializes NeoPixel LEDs, and sets pin modes. In the loop, it calculates distances, triggers actions based on predefined thresholds, and updates the NeoPixel strip. This system enhances safety by providing immediate visual and auditory feedback for maintaining social distance, aiding in public health efforts.
